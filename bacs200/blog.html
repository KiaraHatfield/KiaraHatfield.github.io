                <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    There are many social aspects in regards to immigrants. One of them being their employment, 
                    most immigrants come to America to try and have a better life and get better jobs and have a 
                    fresh start. Also a chunk of those immigrants send money back home to their families. This 
                    would be completely fine if they were legal immigrants but the system we have currently is 
                    difficult and takes 7 years to become a legal citizen. With the process taking so long there 
                    are immigrants who aren’t able to work or provide for their families. That means that them and 
                    their children will have a hard time integrating with society.

                <h3>Economical Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the economical impact that legalized immigrants would have with a better 
                    reform that enables a future flow of legal workers and would result in a cumulative $1.5 trillion 
                    in added U.S. gross domestic product over 10 years. In contrast, a deportation-only policy would 
                    result in a loss of $2.6 trillion in GDP over 10 years. If the government made the legalization 
                    process easier then it would only have a positive effect economically. One of the reasons some 
                    people hate immigrants is because if they are illegal then they are working but dont have to 
                    pay taxes. If they were legalized then they could make more money and pay taxes so that problem 
                    would be much less significant

                <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of debate over this topic especially lately. You could look at the time Trump was 
                    in office and point out that the Trump administration reduced the number of undocumented immigrants 
                    in the United State, a group that totaled roughly 10.5 million people in 2017 so technically there 
                    was less illegal immigrants. However the problem shouldn’t be that they are in “our” country but that 
                    they are illegal. If they were legal then there shouldn’t be this huge problem over it in fact our 
                    country would benefit. They are producers and consumers and would help our country expand just like 
                    any other citizen but instead people are focusing on pushing them out of this country.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    In conclusion people are focusing on the wrong issue; that there is illegal immigrants in our country 
                    taking our jobs. When in reality they are just trying to become a citizen but even so it takes 7 years 
                    for them to complete that process and if the immigration reform made it easier for them then they 
                    wouldn’t be illegal they would be a legal American citizen and could work and benefit the economic 
                    and political state of this country while also helping their social integration. We should be a place 
                    where people can come and live out “The American Dream” so why are we pushing people out that are trying 
                    to achieve that?
