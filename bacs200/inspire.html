                <strong>The Person Who Inspires Me</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>There are a lot of people that I look up to in my life however there is one that stands out a little more. His name is Sean but is more known as Jacksepticeye, he is a youtuber and company owner.</p>
            <p>For 8 years I have watched him and his channel grow and I agree with a lot of his morals and thoughts about the world and life. Mental health is very important to him so he isnâ€™t afraid to take a mental break or to openly talk about darker topics which over time has created a safe space for his followers and has definitely helped me more than once.</p>
            <p>He not only inspires me to take care of myself and my mental health but to reach for my goals. He started as a small youtube channel but today he owns a coffee company, co-owns a clothing company, has been in large production movies, met and become friends with celebrities like Ryan Renolds, and is in a place where he is happy and successful. Seeing his accomplishments and what he has been thorough inspires me to reach for what I want to do in life so I am happy with my job and what I have done.</p>
            <p>His outlook on life is a very positive but realistic one. He always pushes for positivity and wants to make people laugh and be happier to make their world a bit brighter at least when they watch his videos. He talks about being truthful to others and yourself and is very open to things like the LGBTQ+ community. He also does research into topics so he isn't just unknowingly talking and tries to look at both sides to subjects. He tries to push his followers to do the same and be educated in subjects before speaking about them or choosing a side and trying to be open minded to people and their beliefs.</p>
            <p>Overall, I could talk about him for a while but he is someone who has helped me to see the world in a different way and to reach for my goals even if they seem out of reach for the time being and when there's an opportunity to take it.</p>
