</h1>The Person Who Inspires Me</h1>
<p>There are a lot of people that I look up to in my life however there is one that stands out a little more. His name is Sean but is more known as Jacksepticeye, he is a youtuber and company owner.</p>
<p>For 8 years I have watched him and his channel grow and I agree with a lot of his morals and thoughts about the world and life. Mental health is very important to him so he isnâ€™t afraid to take a mental break or to openly talk about darker topics which over time has created a safe space for his followers and has definitely helped me more than once.</p>
<p>He not only inspires me to take care of myself and my mental health but to reach for my goals. He started as a small youtube channel but today he owns a coffee company, co-owns a clothing company, has been in large production movies, met and become friends with celebrities like Ryan Renolds, and is in a place where he is happy and successful. Seeing his accomplishments and what he has been thorough inspires me to reach for what I want to do in life so I am happy with my job and what I have done.</p>
