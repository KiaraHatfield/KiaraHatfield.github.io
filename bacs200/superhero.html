                            Ant-Man has the power to shrink himself (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an ant and return to normal. Over time, he has acquired the 
                            ability to change size at will. He can also shrink to sub-microscopic size, and thereby enter the countless "subatomic universes". He retains his normal strength in 
                            ant size. The cybernetic Ant-Man helmet allows rudimentary telepathic communication with insects, and is equipped with sound amplification equipment allowing normal-sized 
                            humans to hear him. He was also able to go down to a sub-atomic level and come back.

                            When he grows or shrinks in size each has it's own limits. For example when he became huge he moved very slow. Changing size also takes a toll on his body and his mind.

                            T'Challa can be very over-convident and can make him hard to work with in a team. He usually goes based off his own beliefs and his own goals
                            even if he doesn't understand the situaion. Overall he usually isn't a good team player.

                            His strength and agility stand far above an average human, allowing him to lift nearly ten tons and to leap and move at incredible speeds with high accuracy. 
                            He also heals faster than normal when injured. He uses his webs in battle and as a way to travel. He can also stick to surfaces like walls and ceilings which help him in combat.

                            But some might say that he gave her strength. Some weaknesses are more like firearms, or in the beginning a lack of knowledge for the outside world.
