                            Ant-Man has the power to shrink himself (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an ant and return to normal. Over time, he has acquired the ability to change size at will. 
                            He can also shrink to sub-microscopic size, and thereby enter the countless "subatomic universes". He retains his normal strength in ant size. The cybernetic Ant-Man helmet allows rudimentary 
                            telepathic communication with insects, and is equipped with sound amplification equipment allowing normal-sized humans to hear him. He was also able to go down to a sub-atomic level and come back.

                            When he grows or shrinks in size each has it's own limits. For example when he became huge he moved very slow. Changing size also takes a toll on his body and his mind.

                            T'Challa can be very over-convident and can make him hard to work with in a team. He usually goes based off his own beliefs and his own goals
                            even if he doesn't understand the situaion. Overall he usually isn't a good team player.

                            Strange has been able to use his spells to bind opponents and create complex shields and barriers. he can also create portals to different places 
                            for transportation or as a stratigec skill to use in combat. He also uses the power of the time stone (one of the six infinity stones)

                            Doctor Strange weakness is more that he works by himself and a close frined but doesn't really tell people about decisions he made. 
                            He is more on the side of preserving earth and the Sanctums around the earth. He usually doesn't work with others unless 100% needed.

                            His strength and agility stand far above an average human, allowing him to lift nearly ten tons and to leap and move at incredible speeds with high accuracy. 
                            He also heals faster than normal when injured. He uses his webs in battle and as a way to travel. He can also stick to surfaces like walls and ceilings which help him in combat.

                            But some might say that he gave her strength. Some weaknesses are more like firearms, or in the beginning a lack of knowledge for the outside world.
